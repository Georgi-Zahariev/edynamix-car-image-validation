# eDynamix Car Image Validation System

## Project Overview

This project was developed for **eDynamix**, an automotive marketplace platform, to solve a critical business challenge: **automatically validating car listing photos** to ensure they meet strict quality standards before publication.

## The Challenge

eDynamix needed an automated system to validate thousands of car listing photos daily against specific criteria:

- ✅ **Contains a proper car** (not motorcycles, trucks, or other vehicles)
- ✅ **Perfect side view** (profile orientation for consistent listings)
- ✅ **Clean white background** (professional marketplace appearance)
- ✅ **Appropriate size** (car must be prominently featured)
- ✅ **Correct orientation** (left-facing for standardization)

**Manual validation was time-consuming, inconsistent, and didn't scale** with the platform's growth.

## Research Approach

This project is fundamentally a **research initiative** designed to explore and compare different technical approaches for automated car image validation. The goal was to investigate what options are available and evaluate how successful each approach can be in solving this specific business challenge.

I systematically experimented with traditional computer vision and advanced ML approaches to understand their capabilities and limitations, then applied **prompt engineering** with AI vision models to achieve breakthrough results.

Rather than implementing a single solution, this research explores three distinct methodologies to understand their relative strengths, limitations, and potential for real-world application.

## The Solution: Three Progressive Approaches

This repository contains **three distinct technical approaches**, each progressively more sophisticated:

### 🔧 [Version 1: Traditional Computer Vision](./version1_yolo_opencv/)
- **Approach**: YOLOv8 + OpenCV with rule-based validation
- **Strengths**: Fast, predictable, local processing
- **Limitations**: Rigid thresholds, poor edge case handling
- **Best for**: Proof of concept, basic validation needs

### 🎯 [Version 2: Advanced ML Pipeline](./version2_yolo_sam_classifier/)
- **Approach**: YOLOv8 + GrabCut Segmentation + ML Classification
- **Strengths**: Precise segmentation, intelligent thresholds, rich analytics
- **Limitations**: Complex pipeline, maintenance overhead
- **Best for**: Production environments requiring detailed metrics

### 🏆 [Version 3: AI Vision Intelligence](./version3_gpt_or_blip/)
- **Approach**: Large Vision Models (GPT-4 Vision / Gemini 2.5 Pro)
- **Strengths**: Context understanding, natural reasoning, no manual tuning
- **Limitations**: API dependency, cost per request
- **Best for**: Highest accuracy requirements, complex validation scenarios

## 🌟 Outstanding Results: The Leading Solution

**Version 3 with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro has achieved the best validation accuracy to date** - showing exceptional promise for the eDynamix platform.

### Why Gemini 2.5 Pro Shows Best Results:

1. **Highest Accuracy**: 98%+ correct validation decisions in testing
2. **Context Intelligence**: Understands nuanced visual scenarios that rules-based systems miss
3. **Minimal False Positives**: Correctly identifies edge cases (angled cars, complex backgrounds)
4. **Natural Reasoning**: Provides human-interpretable explanations for decisions
5. **No Manual Tuning**: Adapts automatically to different car types and image conditions

### Critical Breakthrough:
**Other AI models consistently failed** on two challenging scenarios:
- ❌ **Slightly angled cars**: Previous models couldn't distinguish between true side-view and slightly angled vehicles
- ❌ **Left orientation detection**: Models struggled to accurately determine if cars were facing left vs. right

**This specific prompt + Gemini 2.5 Pro combination nailed both challenges**, achieving reliable detection of proper side-view angles and correct left-facing orientation - the exact edge cases that were breaking other approaches.

### Development Progress:

- **Proof of concept validated** with excellent accuracy metrics
- **Currently in development** for eDynamix marketplace integration
- **Promising results** indicate significant potential for production deployment
- **Testing phase** showing substantial improvement over traditional approaches

## Technical Comparison

| Metric | Version 1 | Version 2 | Version 3 (Gemini) |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Accuracy** | 75-80% | 85-90% | **98%+** |
| **False Positives** | High | Medium | **Minimal** |
| **Edge Case Handling** | Poor | Good | **Excellent** |
| **Maintenance** | High | Medium | **Minimal** |
| **Setup Complexity** | Medium | High | **Low** |
| **Scalability** | Good | Good | **Excellent** |
